# Balance Tweaks

Balance Tweaks is a WIP mod intended to address some of the unbalanced design in Caves of Qud, with an emphasis on making the game more difficult by reducing the power of certain standout items.

## Currently it does the following:
* Anti-Gravity Boots:
  * Charge use increased from 3 to 250
  * Commonality changed from Uncommon to Rare
* Force Bracelet
  * Now has a 10-turn uptime and 50-turn downtime
    * Overloading changes this to a 15-turn uptime and 40-turn downtime
  * Charge use increased from 500 to 1000
